# Sean Kempf - React Portfolio

This version of my portfolio will be updated to allow for the use of React as a UI library. A few reasons that this is helpful, firstly, is that React is super powerful. The use of components and routers makes the user experience smooth. Secondly, to show that as a developer, I can use React properly.
