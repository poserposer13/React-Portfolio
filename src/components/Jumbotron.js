                I am currently enrolled in the University of Arizona's Coding Boot-camp. I am hoping to end up as a developer because I have found this topic the most interesting I have ever learned. I have graduated Northern Arizona University with a
                    BA of History. While that took me four years, I have only done the boot-camp for about 4 months now and I know I would learn and develop in this area as much as possible. I love being able to work on applications and seeing the progress move forward.

                I am living in Scottsdale, AZ at the moment. I currently work at W.L. Gore & Associates as a Training Champion. I help plan training, coach trainers, and select new trainers for the product line I work with. I have been doing this for almost 3 years now.
                    Before this, I primarily worked in restaurant jobs while I finished school, and a little after.
