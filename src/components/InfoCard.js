                I am currently enrolled in the University of Arizona's Coding Boot-camp. I am hoping to end up as a developer because I have found this topic the most interesting I have ever learned. I have graduated Northern Arizona University with a
                BA of History. While that took me four years, I have only done the boot-camp for about 4 months now and I know I would learn and develop in this area as much as possible. I love being able to work on applications and seeing the progress move forward.
